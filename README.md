Fentanyl Crisis Data Analysis Project

Overview: This project analyzes the fentanyl crisis in the United States, focusing on opioid-related deaths and their patterns across demographics, geography, and time. Using Excel and Tableau, I performed comprehensive data cleaning, manipulation, analysis, and visualization to extract meaningful insights that could inform government interventions.
Background: The fentanyl crisis has emerged as a widespread threat to public health in the United States. From just 3% of opioid-related deaths in 2013, fentanyl now accounts for 80%, killing more than 73,000 lives in 2022 alone. This 300% increase particularly impacts young adults ages 18-45.

Tools Used: 

- Microsoft Excel (Data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis)
- Excel VBA (Custom functions and automations)
- Tableau (Advanced visualization and dashboard creation)

Data Processing Methodology

1. Data Collection
- Dataset sourced from academic curriculum management system
- Performed quality control checks to ensure data integrity
- Documented source and format for reproducibility

2. Data Cleanup
   
Applied five key cleaning principles:
- Removed duplicate records
- Identified and handled missing values
- Standardized formats and text using VBA
- Trimmed whitespace
- Auto-fitted rows and columns for better readability

3. Data Manipulation

Advanced techniques employed:
- Standardized date formats using VBA
- Split geographic coordinate data into new columns
- Removed columns with >20% missing values
- Filled missing values appropriately (using "Unknown" and statistical inference)
- Created age and date binning for better analysis

4. Data Analysis

Multiple analytical approaches:
- Descriptive statistics for key variables (age, drug test results)
- Pivot table analysis to identify patterns and relationships
- VLOOKUP implementation for cross-referencing
- Correlation analysis between different substances
- Histogram analysis for age distribution

5. Data Visualization
Created various visualization types:
- Comparative bar charts for gender differences
- Drug substance test distribution by age group
- Location trends over time
- 3D pie charts for manner of death by age group
- Histogram plots for age distribution
- Interactive dashboard in Tableau
