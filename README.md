Fentanyl Crisis Data Analysis Project
Overview
This project analyzes the fentanyl crisis in the United States, focusing on opioid-related deaths and their patterns across demographics, geography, and time. Using Excel and Tableau, I performed comprehensive data cleaning, manipulation, analysis, and visualization to extract meaningful insights that could inform government interventions.
Background
The fentanyl crisis has emerged as a widespread threat to public health in the United States. From just 3% of opioid-related deaths in 2013, fentanyl now accounts for 80%, killing more than 73,000 lives in 2022 alone. This 300% increase particularly impacts young adults ages 18-45.
Tools Used

Microsoft Excel (Data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis)
Excel VBA (Custom functions and automations)
Tableau (Advanced visualization and dashboard creation)

Data Processing Methodology
1. Data Collection

Dataset sourced from academic curriculum management system
Performed quality control checks to ensure data integrity
Documented source and format for reproducibility

2. Data Cleanup
Applied five key cleaning principles:

Removed duplicate records
Identified and handled missing values
Standardized formats and text using VBA
Trimmed whitespace
Auto-fitted rows and columns for better readability

3. Data Manipulation
Advanced techniques employed:

Standardized date formats using VBA
Split geographic coordinate data into new columns
Removed columns with >20% missing values
Filled missing values appropriately (using "Unknown" and statistical inference)
Created age and date binning for better analysis

4. Data Analysis
Multiple analytical approaches:

Descriptive statistics for key variables (age, drug test results)
Pivot table analysis to identify patterns and relationships
VLOOKUP implementation for cross-referencing
Correlation analysis between different substances
Histogram analysis for age distribution

5. Data Visualization
Created various visualization types:

Comparative bar charts for gender differences
Drug substance test distribution by age group
Location trends over time
3D pie charts for manner of death by age group
Histogram plots for age distribution
Interactive dashboard in Tableau

Key Findings

Demographics:

Males are significantly more affected than females (3,707 vs 1,299 deaths)
White individuals show higher rates of drug-related deaths
The 19-35 and 36-50 age groups are most heavily impacted


Substance Patterns:

Heroin, fentanyl, and other opioids are the most frequently detected substances
Moderate positive correlations exist between fentanyl and its analogues
Many victims tested positive for multiple substances


Temporal Trends:

Significant increase in opioid-related incidents over the study period (2012-2018)
Particularly sharp rise in fentanyl-related deaths



Recommendations

Enhanced Rehabilitation and Treatment Programs:

Expand access to Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT)
Increase availability of psychotherapy and behavioral treatments
Strengthen peer support and recovery services


Strengthen Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMPs):

Improve monitoring and surveillance systems
Enhance provider education on prescribing guidelines
Promote interstate database interoperability


Public Awareness Campaigns:

Educate about risks of opioid abuse and addiction
Promote responsible opioid use
Expand naloxone distribution and training
